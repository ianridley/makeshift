Description: A build system using recursive make.
 Makeshift is a build system implemented as GNU make files.  It provides
 default implementations of the "standard" high-level targets used for
 common software and documentation tasks, as described in the GNU make
 manual (i.e. "build", "clean", "distclean", "install" etc.).
