# Contents:
# main:         --Build a program from a file that contains "main".
# subdir/lib.a: --Force sublibs do be re-evaluated
#
# Remarks:
# The "ld" module defines pattern rules for building executables from
# a list of objects and/or libraries.  the $(LD) macro automatically
# defaults to the C or C++ compiler, so you shouldn't need to set it
# in most circumstances.
#
# The behaviour of ld can be customised with $(LDFLAGS).
#
include coverage.mk

#
# The command "ld" is rarely invoked directly, it's more common that it's
# exec'd by a compiler.  When including the lang/*.mk for the language to
# be compiled, the language may override LD with its variation.  If not,
# LD falls back to $(CC).

# depends on it.  For other sub-directory dependants, an explicit
# rule (similar to this) must be used.
